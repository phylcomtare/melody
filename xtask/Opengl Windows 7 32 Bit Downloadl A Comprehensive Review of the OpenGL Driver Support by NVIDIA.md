# How to Download and Install OpenGL on Windows 7 32 Bit
 
OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API that allows developers to create high-performance 2D and 3D applications. OpenGL is widely used in the gaming industry, as well as in computer-aided design (CAD), simulation, and visualization. If you want to run OpenGL applications on your Windows 7 32 bit system, you need to download and install the appropriate drivers and libraries. In this article, we will show you how to do that in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Check Your Graphics Card
 
Before you download and install OpenGL, you need to make sure that your graphics card supports it. To do that, you can use a tool called [GPU Caps Viewer](https://www.ozone3d.net/gpu_caps_viewer/), which is a free and lightweight program that displays information about your graphics card and its capabilities. Download and run GPU Caps Viewer, and look for the OpenGL section. You should see the version of OpenGL that your graphics card supports, as well as the extensions and features that are available. If your graphics card supports OpenGL 2.0 or higher, you can proceed to the next step. If not, you may need to update your graphics card driver or buy a new graphics card that supports OpenGL.

## Step 2: Download OpenGL Libraries
 
OpenGL libraries are files that contain the functions and data structures that are needed to run OpenGL applications. There are two main libraries that you need to download: [OpenGL32.dll](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/index_gl.php) and [Glu32.dll](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/index_glu.php). These libraries are provided by the [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/), which is the organization that maintains the OpenGL standard. You can download these libraries from their official website, or from a trusted third-party source such as [DLL-Files.com](https://www.dll-files.com/). Make sure to download the 32 bit versions of these libraries, as they are compatible with your system.
 
## Step 3: Install OpenGL Libraries
 
Once you have downloaded the OpenGL libraries, you need to install them on your system. To do that, you need to copy them to the System32 folder, which is located in C:\Windows\System32. You can use the Windows Explorer or the Command Prompt to do that. If you use the Windows Explorer, simply drag and drop the files to the System32 folder. If you use the Command Prompt, open it as an administrator and type the following commands:
 `
cd C:\Windows\System32
copy C:\path\to\OpenGL32.dll .
copy C:\path\to\Glu32.dll .
` 
Replace C:\path\to\ with the actual location where you downloaded the files. After copying the files, you may need to restart your system for the changes to take effect.

To verify that your OpenGL installation was successful, you can run an OpenGL application or a benchmark tool on your system. For example, you can use [GpuTest](https://www.geeks3d.com/gputest/), which is a free and portable program that tests your graphics card performance using various OpenGL scenes. Download and run GpuTest, and select one of the tests from the menu. You should see a window with a 3D scene rendered by OpenGL. If the test runs smoothly and without errors, congratulations! You have successfully installed OpenGL on your Windows 7 32 bit system.
