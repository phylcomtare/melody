## Method 1: Rename or Delete the Locale Folder
 
This method is based on a suggestion from a Steam user who had a similar problem[^1^]. To try this method, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the folder where you installed Dawn of War 2. It should be something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dawn of War II - Retribution`.
2. Find the folder named `Locale` and rename it to something else, like `Locale_old`, or delete it entirely.
3. Launch Steam and go to your library. Right-click on Dawn of War 2 and select `Properties`.
4. Go to the `Language` tab and select `English` from the drop-down menu.
5. Click `OK` and close the properties window.
6. Steam will verify the game files and download the English language pack for you.
7. Launch the game and enjoy it in English.

## Method 2: Edit the Steam.ini File
 
This method is based on a suggestion from a Reddit user who had downloaded a repack of Dawn of War 2 from xatab-repack.com[^2^]. To try this method, follow these steps:

1. Go to the folder where you installed Dawn of War 2. It should be something like `C:\Games\Dawn of War II - Retribution`.
2. Find the file named `steam.ini` and open it with a text editor like Notepad.
3. Look for a line that says `Language=russian` and change it to `Language=english`.
4. Save and close the file.
5. Launch the game and enjoy it in English.

## Troubleshooting Tips
 
If none of the methods above work for you, here are some tips that might help you solve your problem:

- Make sure you have enough disk space to download the English language pack. It might be around 1 GB or more depending on your version of the game.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection to download the language pack. If your connection is slow or unstable, it might cause errors or corruption during the download.
- If you have a pirated or repacked version of the game, make sure you have applied any necessary cracks or patches to make it work. Some cracks or patches might interfere with the language settings or prevent Steam from verifying the game files.
- If you have any mods or customizations installed for Dawn of War 2, make sure they are compatible with the English language pack. Some mods or customizations might overwrite or conflict with the language files or settings.
- If all else fails, you might have to uninstall and reinstall the game, and then change the language to English before launching it for the first time. This might be a hassle, but it might be the only way to ensure a clean installation of the game and its language pack.
