# How to Download Firebug for Firefox 16.0.2
 
Firebug is a web development tool that integrates with Firefox and allows you to edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page[^1^]. It is a useful tool for web developers who want to inspect and tweak the code of their websites.

However, Firebug is no longer maintained and updated by its developers, and it is not compatible with the latest versions of Firefox. The last version of Firebug was 2.0.19, which was released in October 2016 and only works with Firefox versions up to 49[^2^]. If you are using Firefox 16.0.2, which was released in November 2012, you can still download and install Firebug 2.0.19 from the official website[^1^]. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Go to [https://getfirebug.com/downloads](https://getfirebug.com/downloads) and click on the link for Firebug 2.0.19.
2. Save the file firebug-2.0.19.xpi to your computer.
3. Open Firefox 16.0.2 and go to the menu button (the three horizontal bars) and click on Add-ons.
4. Click on the gear icon and select Install Add-on From File.
5. Browse to the location where you saved firebug-2.0.19.xpi and select it.
6. Click on Install Now and restart Firefox when prompted.
7. Firebug should now be installed and you can access it by clicking on the Firebug icon (a bug with a flame) in the toolbar or by pressing F12.

Note that Firebug is no longer supported by its developers and may not work properly with some websites or features. It is recommended that you switch to the latest version of Firefox and use the built-in developer tools instead[^1^]. You can also try other web development tools such as Chrome DevTools or Web Inspector.
  
If you want to learn more about Firebug and how to use it for web development, you can check out the official website which has a lot of documentation, tutorials, and tips. You can also visit the Firebug blog to read about the latest news and updates on Firebug. You can also join the Firebug community on Google Groups, Stack Overflow, or Twitter to ask questions, share feedback, or report bugs.
 
Firebug has been a pioneer and a leader in web development tools for many years, and it has helped millions of web developers create amazing websites. However, as the web evolves and new technologies emerge, Firebug has become outdated and incompatible with modern browsers. The Firebug team has decided to stop working on Firebug and focus on contributing to the Firefox developer tools instead. The Firefox developer tools are based on some of the features and concepts of Firebug, but they are more advanced, powerful, and integrated with Firefox. They offer a range of tools such as inspector, console, debugger, network monitor, performance analyzer, storage inspector, accessibility inspector, and more. You can access them by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I or by clicking on the menu button and selecting Web Developer.
 
If you are still using Firefox 16.0.2 and Firebug 2.0.19, you may want to consider upgrading to the latest version of Firefox and switching to the Firefox developer tools. You will get a better browsing experience, more security and privacy, and more web development features. You can download the latest version of Firefox from [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). You can also learn more about the Firefox developer tools from [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools).
